Module not found: Can't 
resolve 'canvas'
Did you mean './canvas'?
Requests that should 
resolve in the current 
directory need to start 
with './'.
Requests that start with 
a name are treated as 
module requests and 
resolve within module 
directories 
(node_modules).
If changing the source 
code is not an option 
there is also a resolve 
options called 
'preferRelative' which 
tries to resolve these 
kind of requests in the 
current directory too.
